# re-writing the classification model
# this time we will just do a maximum likelihood approach over ALL possible underlying sequences
# use some np vectorization tricks from Ben P. to speed everything up computations

# to do list:
# - decrease the "overhang" parameter, so that for e.g. 6x a nucleosome can extend a bit more off the edge and permit the last guy to be bound
# - - was 40, now making it 30? might make more sense to just require idk at least 3 gpcs at the end to call it but this seems harder to code rn
# - maybe require middle guys to be accessible? but i guess we still can't explain the hemi-methylated guys...
# - there are still some cases (see screenshot on desktop) where i guess the exact positioning of nucleosomes means it's better to mess up two gpcs next to the flanks and get in another nuc, rather than have one fewer nuc and get binding right, have to fix this (upweighting getting the bases around tetos right?)
# - - i think both last two points can potentially be solved by increasing the weighting in the log likelihood of the middle bases, or the guys immediately next to the flanking guys, although sometimes there is still weird behavior. idk it's mostly right but we can talk about this
# - i think we want to decrease the nucleosome length, to what we measure in our data, i don't think a 150bp long streak (from gpc start to gpc end) is reasonable
# - - was (130,150), now trying (100,140), which I think is basically FWHM of the longest protection length distribution
